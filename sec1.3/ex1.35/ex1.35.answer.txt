Exercise 1.35.  Show that the golden ratio p (section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the transformation x |-> 1 + 1/x, and use this fact to compute p by means of the fixed-point procedure.

###

The golden ratio satisfies this equation:
p^2 = p + 1


The formula given in the exercise is equivalent to the above; we can derive it by dividing by both sides the golden ratio equation. We get:
p = 1 + 1/x
