The output of the program is in the files named ex1.22.output*.txt.



The timings recorded are:

10^13 ~ 1.5 seconds
10^14 ~ 4.7 seconds
10^15 ~ 15  seconds
10^16 ~ 45  seconds
10^17 ~ 143 seconds


Each successive line starts from n*10 so one could expect
sqrt(10) more time expended for finding the prime.

sqrt(10) ~ 3.1

Infact the ratio between timings satisfy the hipotesis:
4.7/1.5 ~ 3.13
15/4.7  ~ 3.19
45/15   = 3
143/45  ~ 3.17
