Exercise 1.24.  Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat test has (log n) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

The tests confirm the (log n) complexity.
I wrote the test in a way that n grows exponentially: 10^6, 10^9, 10^12 ...
So, the time increases linearly as shown from the plot of the timings.
