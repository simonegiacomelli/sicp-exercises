Exercise 1.25.  Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written

(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

###

This procedure calculate the full base^exponent; in contrast the previous make multiple reminder calculation and the intermediate maximum value treated is much smaller.
With this in mind, we could account for an increased time complexity to handle such huge numbers.
