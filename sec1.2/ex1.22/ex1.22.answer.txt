The output of the program is in the files named ex1.22.output*.txt.
The primes requested are there.


The timings recorded are:

10^13 ~ 1.5  seconds
10^14 ~ 4.6  seconds
10^15 ~ 14.7 seconds
10^16 ~ 46   seconds
10^17 ~ 146  seconds


Each successive line starts from n*10 so one could expect
sqrt(10) more time expended for finding the prime.

sqrt(10) ~ 3.1

In-fact the ratio between timings satisfy the hypothesis:
4.6/1.5  ~ 3.06
14.7/4.6 ~ 3.19
46/14.7  = 3.13
146/46   ~ 3.17

So, yes my result is compatible with the notion that programs on my
machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required 
for the computation.
